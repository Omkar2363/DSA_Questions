        /*Ques : Given two unsorted arrays that represent two sets (elements in every array are distinct),
                 find the union and intersection of two arrays.

                 For example, if the input arrays are:

                        arr1[] = {7, 1, 5, 2, 3, 6}
                        arr2[] = {3, 8, 6, 20, 7}

                Then your program should print Union as {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20} and Intersection as {3, 6, 7}.
                Note that the elements of union and intersection can be printed in any order.
