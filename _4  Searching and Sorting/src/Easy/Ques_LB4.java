        /*Ques : Given three distinct numbers A, B and C. Find the number with value in middle
                 (Try to do it with minimum comparisons).


                Example : 1
                Input   : A = 978, B = 518, C = 300
                Output  : 518
                Explanation : Since 518>300 and 518<978, so 518 is the middle element.


                Example : 2
                Input   : A = 162, B = 934, C = 200
                Output  : 200
                Explanation : Since 200>162 && 200<934, So, 200 is the middle element.

                Your Task :
                You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function middle()
                which takes three integers A,B and C as input parameters and returns the number which has middle value.


                Expected Time Complexity  : O(1)
                Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)
