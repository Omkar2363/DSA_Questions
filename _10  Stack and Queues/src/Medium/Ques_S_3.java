    //Ques : Design and Implement Special Stack Data Structure | Added Space Optimized Version.....   (GFG Ques.)


    //Approach 1 : By using two Stacks.......
    /*  Solution :
         - By using two stacks : one to store actual stack elements and the other as an auxiliary stack
                                 to store minimum values. The idea is to do push() and pop() operations
                                 in such a way that the top of the auxiliary stack is always the minimum.

             # Let us see how push() and pop() operations work.

                * Push(int x)                                      // inserts an element x to Special Stack
                    1) push x to the first stack (the stack with actual elements)
                    2) compare x with the top element of the second stack (the auxiliary stack). Let the top element be y.
                          a. If x is smaller than y then push x to the auxiliary stack.
                          b. If x is greater than y then push y to the auxiliary stack.
                * int Pop()                                      // removes an element from Special Stack and
                                                                 // return the removed element

                    1) pop the top element from the auxiliary stack.
                    2) pop the top element from the actual stack and return it. Step 1 is necessary to
                       make sure that the auxiliary stack is also updated for future operations.

                * int getMin()                                   // returns the minimum element from Special Stack
                    1) Return the top element of the auxiliary stack.

                We can see that all the above operations are O(1).

         - Let us see an example. Let us assume that both stacks are initially empty and
           18, 19, 29, 15, and 16 are inserted to the SpecialStack.

               -> When we insert 18, both stacks change to following.
                    Actual Stack
                    18 <--- top
                    Auxiliary Stack
                    18 <---- top

               -> When 19 is inserted, both stacks change to following.
                    Actual Stack
                    19 <--- top
                    18
                    Auxiliary Stack
                    18 <---- top
                    18

               -> When 29 is inserted, both stacks change to following.
                    Actual Stack
                    29 <--- top
                    19
                    18
                    Auxiliary Stack
                    18 <---- top
                    18
                    18

                -> When 15 is inserted, both stacks change to following.
                    Actual Stack
                    15 <--- top
                    29
                    19
                    18
                    Auxiliary Stack
                    15 <---- top
                    18
                    18
                    18

               -> When 16 is inserted, both stacks change to following.
                    Actual Stack
                    16 <--- top
                    15
                    29
                    19
                    18
                    Auxiliary Stack
                    15 <---- top
                    15
                    18
                    18

            Example : 1
            Consider the following SpecialStack

            15

            When getMin() is called it should return 15, which is the minimum element in the current stack.

            If we do pop two times on stack, the stack becomes
            29  --> TOP
            19
            18

            When getMin() is called, it should return 18 which is the minimum in the current stack.
