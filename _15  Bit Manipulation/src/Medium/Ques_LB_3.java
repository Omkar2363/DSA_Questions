        /*Ques : Given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count the number of bits needed to be flipped
                 to convert A to B.

            Example : 1
            Input   : A = 10, B = 20
            Output  : 4
            Explanation : Binary representation of A is 00001010
                          Binary representation of B is 00010100
                          We need to flip highlighted four bits in A to make it B.

            Example : 2
            Input   : A = 7, B = 10
            Output  : 3
            Explanation : Binary representation of A is 00000111
                          Binary representation of B is 00001010
                          We need to flip highlighted three bits in A to make it B.
