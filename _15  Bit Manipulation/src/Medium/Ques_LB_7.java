    //Approach 1 :


    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*Ques : Given two numbers x and y, and a range [l, r] where 1 <= l, r <= 32.
                 The task is, consider set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also.

            Example : 1
            Input   : x = 10, y = 13, l = 2, r = 3
            Output  : x = 14
            Explanation : Binary representation of 10 is 1010 and that of y is 1101.
                          There is one set bit, in y at 3'rd position (in given range).
                          After, we copy this bit to x, x becomes 1110 which is binary representation of 14.

            Example : 2
            Input   : x = 8, y = 7, l = 1, r = 2
            Output  : x = 11
