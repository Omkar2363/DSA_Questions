    //Ques : Find position of the only set bit............                                     (GFG Ques.)

    //Approach 1 :




    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*Ques : Given a number N having only one ‘1’ and all other ’0’s in its binary representation, find position
                 of the only set bit. If there are 0 or more than 1 set bit the answer should be -1.
                 Position of set bit ‘1’ should be counted starting with 1 from the LSB side in the binary representation
                 of the number.


            Example : 1
            Input   : N = 2
            Output  : 2
            Explanation : 2 is represented as "10" in Binary.
                          As we see there's only one set bit and it's at Position 2 and
                          thus the Output is : 2.

            Example : 2
            Input   : N = 5
            Output  : -1
            Explanation : 5 is represented as "101" in Binary.
                          As we see there's two set bits and
                          thus the Output -1.
